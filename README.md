# `pip install JoBase`

Welcome to JoBase - one of the fastest Python game libraries.

Feel free to check out the website for tutorials and demos, but be warned! The upcoming JoBase 3.1 has had major changes. You may have to tweak your projects before they work on the new version of JoBase.

## Upcoming Changes

- Support for Python 3.13+
- No more physics engine ([Pymunk](https://www.pymunk.org) does the same thing)
- `cursor` renamed to `mouse`
- `Rectangle` renamed to `Rect`
- New render engine (SDL instead of GLFW)

## Exciting Updates

JoBase now has full browser support. Soon, you'll be able to code in a Python online sandbox, and share your projects with friends.
